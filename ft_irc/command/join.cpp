// 3.2.1 Join message

//       Command: JOIN
//    Parameters: ( <channel> *( "," <channel> ) [ <key> *( "," <key> ) ] )
//                / "0"

//    The JOIN command is used by a user to request to start listening to
//    the specific channel.  Servers MUST be able to parse arguments in the
//    form of a list of target, but SHOULD NOT use lists when sending JOIN
//    messages to clients.

//    Once a user has joined a channel, he receives information about
//    all commands his server receives affecting the channel.  This
//    includes JOIN, MODE, KICK, PART, QUIT and of course PRIVMSG/NOTICE.
//    This allows channel members to keep track of the other channel
//    members, as well as channel modes.

//    If a JOIN is successful, the user receives a JOIN message as
//    confirmation and is then sent the channel's topic (using RPL_TOPIC) and
//    the list of users who are on the channel (using RPL_NAMREPLY), which
//    MUST include the user joining.

//    Note that this message accepts a special argument ("0"), which is
//    a special request to leave all channels the user is currently a member
//    of.  The server will process this message as if the user had sent
//    a PART command (See Section 3.2.2) for each channel he is a member
//    of.
